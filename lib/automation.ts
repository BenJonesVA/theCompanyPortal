/**
 * Applies matching automation rules for a trigger event, in a single pass,
 * directly via prisma.ticket.update — never by calling back through the
 * ticket Server Actions, and never by re-invoking this function. That's what
 * prevents a rule whose action re-fires the same trigger type it reacts to
 * (e.g. a CHANGE_STATUS action wired into the STATUS_CHANGED trigger) from
 * cascading or looping. Callers must NOT wrap this call in anything that
 * re-triggers automation for the same ticket.
 *
 * IDLE_TIME_EXCEEDED is the one trigger type this function does NOT expect to
 * be called synchronously from a ticket action — it's driven by the cron
 * sweep at app/api/cron/idle-sweep/route.ts, which is the only caller that
 * passes it. `now` is injectable so that sweep can evaluate every ticket in a
 * batch against a single consistent instant.
