# Multi-stage build for a production-style image. Local day-to-day dev still
# uses `npm run dev` on the host (fast, hot reload) — this is for testing
# prod parity and eventual deployment, not for editing code inside a
# container. See docker-compose.yml for how this plugs into the rest of the
# stack, and the `migrate` service (which reuses the `builder` stage) for how
# migrations get applied without bloating this runtime image with the full
# Prisma CLI.
